<p><em>RICIN</em><br>Ricin is usually extracted from the castor bean and is considered one of the deadliest poisons
    known to human. A small amount can cause death. Ricin stops
    the protein a human needs for survival, and the person goes into shock. As it can be produced very easily, other
    countries started to use it as a weapon.</p><br>

<h1>2. <strong>VX</strong></h1>

     height="250px" width="300px">

<p><em>VX</em><br>VX is the deadliest nerve gas known to Humanity. It was initially marketed as a pesticide but was soon
    banned as it was extremely dangerous to human beings. It is the deadliest poison ever manufactured.
    Even a single drop of VX can be fatal. VX was banned as a pesticide, but soon caught attention of the government of
    several countries and started
    using them it like a weapon.</p><br>

<h1>1. <strong>BOTULINUM</strong></h1>

<p>Botulinum is THE deadliest poison known to humanity. There are two types, a and b. When a human comes within contact
    of this deadly poison the nervous system shuts down immediately
    and the victim dies with a lot of pain. Strangely, Botulinum type a, is used to treat wrinkles in skin.</p>
